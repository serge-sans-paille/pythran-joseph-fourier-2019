Professional curriculum
***********************

.. *If applicable, tell us more about your professional background: highlight
   here the main roles and positions you might have had.*

Throughout is career, Serge Guelton has been employed by INRIA as an engineer
on distributed computing, by three start-ups as a research engineer in
distributed computing and compilation: at Quiet Oceans were he implemented a
distributed ocean noise simulator; at HPC Project were he contributed to an
auto-parallelizing compiler and at QuarksLab where he led the construction of
an LLVM-based obfuscator. He is an active contributor of the LLVM project. In
parallel to his professional career, Serge Guelton has been developing the
Pythran project as an open source personal project, building a user community,
publishing academic and technical papers and presenting his project in
international conferences.

After his PhD, Pierre Augier worked as a post-doctoral researcher for two
projects at the department of mechanics of KTH (Stockholm, Sweden) and at the
Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (Cambridge
University, UK), respectively. He started to work more and more on developing
complex scientific applications and to study how this can be done efficiently
with open-source methods and the Python programming language.

In 2014, in the framework of his research as CNRS researcher, he created the
`FluidDyn project <https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io>`_ (Augier et al. 2019),
which goal is to foster open-science and open-source in fluid dynamics. Today,
FluidDyn is mainly a set of Python packages forming a framework to study fluid
dynamics with different methods, in particular laboratory experiments (package
fluidlab), simulations (packages fluidfft, fluidsim and fluidfoam) and data
processing (package fluidimage). Python and its scientific ecosystem is a great
advantage for a project like FluidDyn, however, one needs good tools to easily
accelerate Python / Numpy code. Pythran produces very efficient binaries
without the need to complicate the code and therefore to compromise simplicity,
readability and portability. Therefore, Pythran has become the main Python /
Numpy accelerator used in FluidDyn and Pierre Augier started to contribute to
the project. Finally, in 2018, Pierre Augier created a side project called
`Transonic <https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/transonic>`_ which makes Pythran
even easier to use and overcomes some of Pythran's limitations (for example no
just-in-time compilation and no acceleration of methods of classes).

Skills
******

.. *Tell us more here about your skills in relation to the submission*

The Pythran project embodies the will of merging academic and engineering
skills in one tool: To touch a large community, good engineering practices,
with a focus on usability and deployment are required. To achieve peak
performance and compete with traditional compiled code, a good knowledge of
hardware constraints is needed. To build a bridge between the high-level
modelling of a problem provided by the Python description and the low-level
description necessary to the HPC field, firm academic grounds is a core
requirement.

Further information
*******************

.. *Provide here any other relevant information: award, patent, collaboration,
   teaching, mentoring, etc.*

The activities of Serge Guelton around the Pythran project have led to a rich
set of interactions with educational, academic and industrial world. He has
mentored several third-years student of Télécom Bretagne on various
compilation-related aspects of Pythran (Alan Raynaud, Adrien Merlini and Éliott
Coyac). He has been presenting his ideas at Super Computing Workshops, at the
Scipy Conference and in the regular French Compilation meetings. The result of
his work on Pythran is now regularly used worldwide by both engineers, PhD
students and researchers (more than 16k downloads on
https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pythran, more than 6k downloads per months on
https://pypistats.org/packages/pythran). It is used at Facebook to speedup some
computational pipelines, at UAudio to accelerate the prototype-to-product
pipeline (see
http://serge-sans-paille.github.io/pythran-stories/pythran-as-a-bridge-between-fast-prototyping-and-code-deployment.html),
an in financial firms to speedup simulation. It is a component of the
https://opendreamkit.org/ European project, in the performance work package.

**Pythran** is an ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python language,
with a focus on scientific computing. It takes a Python module annotated with a
few interface description and turns it into a native Python module with the
same interface, but faster. It is meant to efficiently compile scientific
programs, and takes advantage of multi-cores and SIMD instruction units.

Pythran compilation involves three steps:

1. Optimization of high-level constructs in the Python / Numpy code,
2. Transpilation to optimized C++ code that does not depend on a Python interpreter
3. Compilation of the C++ code.

As a result, the resulting Python extensions are usually very efficient, i.e. as fast as optimized C++ or Fortran.

Since Pythran extensions do not use the Python interpreter, they do not suffer
from issues related to the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for parallel
computing with threads. Moreover, with Pythran, OpenMP directives can be used
in Python codes as in standard compiled languages.

Since Pythran produces C++ code which does not use the Python interpreter, it
can be used as any pure C++ code, for example included in a C++ project or even
compiled to WebAssembly. Thus, Python, Numpy and Pythran form together a very
interesting framework to prototype HPC C++ codes.

However, from the point of view of Python developers, this "pure-C++" choice
has also disadvantages. All functions in the standard library or in Numpy have
to the reimplemented in the Pythran C++ library. It means that external
packages like for example h5py or mpi4py cannot be used in Pythran modules,
which implies that one has to put numerical kernels in dedicated Pythran
modules. It increases the cost to use Pythran on existing Python codes and make
Pythran more complicated to use than Numba, another Pythran compiler.

**Transonic** is a pure Python package to easily accelerate modern Python-Numpy
code with Pythran, with a simple and pythonic API inspired by the Numba API. It
becomes very simple to accelerate any numerical kernels (blocks of code,
functions or methods of classes) just by adding few lines of Python.

Contribution of candidate (Or team)
***********************************

Serge Guelton is the core developer of the Pythran project. As such, he contributed to all the aspects of the compiler:

1. Original design of the compiler infrastructure, with an high-level compilation stage and a low-level compilation stage, and a focus on backward-compatibility with Python,
2. Design and implementation of several compiler optimizations specific to the Python language, including inter-procedural ones
3. Efficient implementation of a large part of the Numpy API in C++, combined with data structure that captures the complexity of Numpy's multi-dimensional arrays
4. Packaging and diffusion of the Pythran compiler through academic conference, engineering conference and blog posts.
5. Continuous testing of API and performance regression (see https://serge-sans-paille.github.io/pythran-asv/)

TODO: Pierre Augier

Originality and difficulty
**************************

Python and its scientific ecosystem is widely used in the scientific community.
Python is suited to communicate ideas between scientists / developers, and to
quickly prototype scientific software. However, Python and its main
interpreters have not been designed for scientific HPC. This framework is not
adapted to develop numerical kernels. Thus, the standard practice is to develop
these kernels in compiled languages (C, Fortran, C++), sometimes through the
use of Cython. Python is mainly used in the scientific community as a very nice
glue language.

Due to its high level of dynamisms and introspection, it is notoriously
difficult to compile full Python code. Pypy, the alternative and faster
interpreter is not able to accelerate Python code using extensions consuming
the CPython C API, so it cannot accelerate Numpy code.

It is therefore an interesting choice for a Python compiler like Pythran to
target only a subset of the Python language, with a focus on scientific
computing. In most cases, it is not difficult (and a good practice) to split a
HPC Python code into a set of numerical kernels (without crazy Python features
and exotic libraries) and the rest of the code, where all Python features and
libraries can be used. Since the expensive numerical computations are mainly in
the numerical kernels, we can reach very good level of efficiency only by
compiling these numerical kernels.

Ahead-of-time compilation of the *simple* Python / Numpy codes of the numerical
kernels is then possible. Having to treat very high-level codes can even be a
opportunity for a compiler, and Pythran is clever to understand high-level
constructs and to apply complex optimizations on them.

Similar work in the community
*****************************

.. *Explain here what makes your work stand out from previous research*

In the Python ecosystem, Pythran can be compared to projects like Cython and
Numba. These two tools are clearly more popular that Pythran. However, Pythran
has very interesting technical advantages.

Cython is a superset of the Python language to write C extensions without
writing C code. It is very mature, widely used and stable. Cython is used in
most of the main packages of the scientific Python ecosystem (for example
Scipy, scikit-learn, scikit-image, ...). It is very versatile and powerful.
However, writing efficient Cython code requires to master both Python, C, the
actual Cython dialect, and part of the CPython C API. Note that Pythran can now
be used from Cython to speed-up Numpy code. In most cases, similar performances
can be achieved only with Pythran with much simpler, readable and elegant
Python-only code. With Pythran, the code is therefore faster to write and easier to
maintain. Moreover, more developers are able to work on it, which is very
important for open-source scientific projects.

Numba is a Python package to perform just-in-time compilation of functions
using a subset of Python / Numpy. Its main advantage is to target CPUs and
GPUs. However, for computations on CPU, it is usually less efficient that
Pythran and the amount of Python / Numpy code supported is smaller. In
particular, Numba does not support well broadcasting and most of algorithms
have to be rewritten with loops, which in many cases decreases the readability
and the generality of the code. Note that with Transonic, Pythran can also be
used as a method-based just-in-time compiler whereas it is not possible to
distribute compiled binaries with Numba. Moreover, accelerating functions and
methods with Pythran/Transonic is as simple as with Numba (with a very similar
API). Another advantage of Pythran over Numba is to produce C++ which does not
depend on a Python interpreter, and which can therefore be used directly in a
pure C++ code.

Python and its scientific ecosystem (including Pythran) can also be compared to
other programming languages, for example Matlab, C++ and Julia. Being both
open-source and dynamic, Julia may be the closest alternative. Using Pythran,
scientific Python can reach the same level of performance than with Julia
(sometimes faster and with cleaner codes, with less loops and macros). The main
advantages of Julia compared to Python with Pythran are the good efficiency of
user-defined types and the possibility to use GPUs. The main advantages of
Python with Pythran compared to Julia are (i) the possibility to distribute
compiled binaries and (ii) the better integration with the scientific Python
ecosystem.

Validation and Tests
********************

.. *Describe here the different steps of your project/research validation. It
   could be either experiments on large-sized cluster or validation from a wider
   community.*

The Pythran stack is composed of a compiler infrastructure with more than
twenty compiler passes, and a C++ runtime which provides a native
implementation of a large subset of Numpy and Python libraries. Validation of
the project is done at several layers:

1. From a functionality point of view, Pythran's testbed consist in more than
   two thousands code snippets for which the testing infrastructure ensures the
   equality between the output of the interpreted code and of the compiled
   code. This is a very strong requirement: for the same input (value and
   type), interpreted and compiled code must have the same output (value and
   type).

2. From a deployment point of view, these tests are run using Continuous
   Integration tools on several systems (Linux, Windows and OSX), for several
   Python versions (Python 2 and Python 3), using different compilers (GCC,
   Clang, MVSC) and different compilation flags (with or without OpenMP, with
   or Without SIMD instructions).

3. From a user base point of view, Pythran bug tracker is very active and
   receives bug reports from academical and industrial users.

Direct and potential impacts
****************************

.. *Describe here the direct and medium-term impacts of your work/research*

Pythran is used by PhD students who can write Python code but don't have the
time to invest in speeding up their simulations. Pythran provides them with a
tool that produces native code, potentially using SIMD instructions and
multiple cores.

Pythran is used by academics as a support for research projects where it
provides a better development time/code speed trade-off than compiled language
like C++ or Fortran. For that use case, the *de facto* compatibility of Pythran
with the Python scientific stack (Jupyter notebook, Matplotlib visualization,
...) is a definite plus.

Pythran is used in the industry because it accelerates the development cycle
without sacrificing performance. Thanks to its Python compatibility, it also
proposes an interesting alternative to the *prototype in Python, reimplement in
a natively compiled language* approach. The ability to generate Python-free
code has proved to be relevant to build general purpose native libraries out of
Python specifications.

Deployment and Community Adoption

Next steps
**********

.. *Describe here the next steps for your research/project.
   [1,125 characters maximum]*

- Usage of Pythran in popular Python packages like scikit-image, scikit-learn
  and even Scipy. After an interesting discussion on the Scipy-dev mailing list,
  the conclusions was that there would be many advantages to use Pythran in Scipy
  and that the main blocker is that Pythran almost totally relies on
  Serge Guelton [#]_.

  It would therefore be interesting for the scientific Python community to
  break this vicious circle: Pythran does not receive sufficient investments
  (in terms of money and development) because it is not yet used in very
  popular projects. And it cannot be used in these big projects because of the
  lack of investments. We hope that this vicious circle will be overcome when
  one or two big projects will adopt Pythran. Some work is being done in
  this direction with Scikit-image [#]_.

.. [#] See https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scipy-dev/2018-May/022837.html.
.. [#] See https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/2956.

- A possible Pythran improvement would be to be able to define and use in the
  numerical kernels simple user-defined types (`Python dataclass
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_ equivalent to C++
  structures).

- We are working on Transonic to be able to use with the same API different
  accelerators (Pythran, Numba, Cython, Cupy, ...). This would be very convenient
  for benchmarking and to compare the different accelerators. It would also help
  to write HPC Python codes able to work with different types of arrays (Numpy
  arrays, Dask arrays, arrays on GPU, etc.).

- A long-term task would be to use Pythran to accelerate Python/Numpy code with
  GPUs. Since Pythran supports OpenMP, a promising method would be to use recent
  OpenMP directives targeting GPUs.
